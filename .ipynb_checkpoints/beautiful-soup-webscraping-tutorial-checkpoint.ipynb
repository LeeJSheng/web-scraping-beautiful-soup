    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "The following packages need to be installed for this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `numpy` for array processing\n",
    "2. `pandas` for data manipulation and cleaning\n",
    "3. `matplotlib` for data visualization\n",
    "4. `seaborn` for further data visualization. It is built upon `matplotlib`\n",
    "5. `beautifulsoup4` Beautiful Soup version 4\n",
    "6. `lxml` a lxml parser for to be used with beautiful soup\n",
